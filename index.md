Hi! I am Sarah Perez. I tried to climb a mountain, not once but thrice, called Black Tusk Mountain. I also make creative things.

Black Tusk Tales is a collection of images, moments, expressions, stories. They are not perfect, sometimes they are not even complete, but like an adventure up a perilous mountain, they are worth it. For me to make and for you to get lost in.
